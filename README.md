# EECS_731-Project_5
In this project, I only implemented one forecasting model which is ARIMA to determine the demand for particular product.

# Project Instruction
 Shipping and delivering to a place near you
1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Download the product demand data set from
https://www.kaggle.com/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting
3. Load the data set into panda data frames
4. Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
5. Build one or more forecasting models to determine the demand for a particular product using the other columns as features
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

# Dataset

# Conclusion
For the reslut, I got the prediction plot for different products in three different features, and the plot shows that the performance of this model is good.
